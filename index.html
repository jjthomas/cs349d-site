<p>Instructors: <a href="http://csl.stanford.edu/~christos/">Christos Kozyrakis</a> and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/">Matei Zaharia</a><br>
Autumn 2017, Mon/Wed 10:30 AM - 12:20 PM, room 380-380W (Sloan Math Center)<br>
3 units<br>
Office hours: TBD</p>

<p> The largest change in the computer industry over the past five years has arguably been the emergence of 
cloud computing: organizations are increasingly moving their workloads to managed public clouds and using new, 
global-scale services that were simply not possible in private datacenters. However, both building and using cloud systems 
remains a black art with many difficult research challenges. This research seminar will cover industry and academic work on 
  cloud computing and survey key technical issues. Students will read and discuss a paper per class meeting and do a quarter-long project in groups of 2-3.</p>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong>
The main evaluation will be around a <a href="#projects">project</a> that students propose and execute during the course.
Apart from that, each student is expected to <a href="#presentations">present</a> one of the papers and to participate in class.
The grading rubric will be 70% project, 15% paper presentation and 15% participation.</p>

<h2 id="projects"><a name="projects">Projects</a></h2>

<p>Students will propose and run a semester-long project, ideally in groups of 2-3.
It is fine to use your existing research project if it is relevant to the course and the instructor approves.
You will present the project at the end of the course and write a 10-12 page report.</p>

  <tr><td>Form groups, run idea by Matei</td><td>October 2</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Final report (10-12 pages)</td><td>December 15</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="paper-presentations"><a name="presentations">Paper Presentations</a></h2>

<p>Each student will be assigned a paper to present during the class.
You should prepare a 15-20 minute presentation on the paper.
In your presentation, cover each of the following:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>Problem: What is the paper trying to solve? How real is the problem?</li>
  <li>Key idea: What is the main idea in the solution?</li>
  <li>Novelty: What is different from previous work, and why? Is it a new problem, a new solution, or a new environment for an existing problem?</li>
  <li>Critique: Is there anything you would change in the solution? What about in the way the authors presented or evaluated the solution?</li>
</ul>
