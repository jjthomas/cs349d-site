    <p>The following is a list of potential topics and ideas for your
    CS349d project. These are starting points that will require
    further development. Please reach out to the instructors for futher
    information.</p> 

  <h3>Serverless Computing</h3>
  <p>This is a great time to explore opportunities in serverless
  computing. The following ideas explore new directions in this area
	with some building on top of recent research at Stanford.</p>

	<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
	  <li> Applications for serverless computing: We recently
	  developed an abstraction that can potentially support a wide
	  range of computation on a serverless platform. The goal of
	  this project is to port important apps on this abstraction
	  and draw insights about its efficacy of the abstraction and
	  the design of the serverless infrastructure. 
	  Applications of interest include MapReduce,
	  Spark, and visual analytics workloads.</li>
	  <li> A portable serverless abstraction: We recently
	  developed an abstraction that can potentially support a wide
	  range of computation on a serverless platform. Its original
	  implementation is for the Amazon Lambda platform. The goal
	  of this project is to port it to open source serverless
	  platforms like OpenWhisk. In addition to improving
	  portability, the new system can be the basis of an full,
	  open source stack for serverless computing. </li>
	  <li>Ephemeral storage: Serverless computing can use existing
	  storage and database services for long term data (e.g.,
	  input and output). However, there is also a need for a new
	  type of storage system for temporary data, one that matches
	  the scaling, speed, and cost properties of serverless
	  computation. This storage system can potential use slack
	  DRAM or Flash capacity across a datacenter. The goal of this
	  project is to explore APIs and design options and
	  implementat a prototype system on an existing cloud
          services. </li>
  	  <li>Scheduling and locality optimizations: Current serverless platforms
	  incur significant overheads for remote access to code and
	  data. The goal of this project is to design and implement
	  optimizations that enhance locality (e.g., send a function
	  to a machine close to the data) or hide latency (e.g.,
	  prefetch data). </li>
	  <li>Serveless for high throughput serving systems:
	  Serverless computing is quite popular with low volume
	  serving applications. For high volume serving application
	  (e.g., websearch), people still use traditional server
	  designs. Can we design a serverless system that can execute
	  efficiently the same code both at low and high volume
	  scenarios? </li>
	  <li>Serverless for accelerators: Does it make sense to
	  extend the serverless platforms for GPUs, FPGAs, and other
	  accelerators? If yes, how does the system look like? </li>
	  <li>The economics of serverless: How should one charge for 
          server less? Alternatively, given the economics and the usage
          characteristics, how should one set the thresholds for constraints
	  (e.g., up to 500 MB disk)? </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Cloud Infrastructure</h3>

	<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">

	  <li> ML for cloud management: Machine learning can be quite
	useful for cluster management as well. For example, we can
	use ML to find good signals for better job placement, e.g.,
	network interference or other performance
	measurements, and build a system that automates cluster
	management tasks based on these signals.  </li>

	<li> Operating system for the cloud: can we build an operating
	system that supports thousands of Lambda functions or
	thousands of threads per machine?</li> 
	
	<li> Rethinking containers and migration: Many companies develop
	cloud services on containers. These containers communicate
	with other services over APIs, in most cases storage or DBs,
	that are also remote. The typical approach to dealing with SLO
	violations in this environment is to kill the container and
	restart it someplace else. Can container migration help get
	the best of both worlds: the simplicity of containers and the
	migration flexibility of VMs? Is current migration technology
	sufficient (CRIU)? Alternatively, can we build on something
	like KVM to build a container system that supports safe
	migratable processes, use a userspace networking stack running
	in the same address space and provide basic filesystem
	abstractions that target a remote storage system? The Intel
	Clear Containers project may be a good starting point. </li>
	</li>
	      
	</ul>
	    
	<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
	<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
	<li>Fault tolerant and elastic deep learning: with constructs such as the spot market available in public clouds, the static network topologies in current distributed deep learning frameworks may not be optimal. How can we make these frameworks tolerate elasticity how much do we gain from it?</li>
	<li>Attacking cloud ML APIs: several papers have shown that for systems that offer ML inference as a service (using a private model from the provider), it’s possible to recover the model after a few requests (e.g., suppose that it was k-dimensional a linear model — you just need k requests). Can you do this for deep learning models?</li>
	</ul>
	    
    	<h3>Programming Models</h3>
	<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
	<li>Can you design a programming model that automatically makes sure a cloud application follows an industry regulation such as HIPAA? Ideally this would look very close to existing programming models (e.g. Lambda or Node.JS) but do this automatically.</li>
	<li>Laptop extension: imagine that you mostly store data in a Dropbox-like distributed file system on your laptop, so it’s also in the cloud. Could you offload tasks such as software builds, video encoding or image rendering to lambda functions or VMs in the cloud?</li>
	</ul>
